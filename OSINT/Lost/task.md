I need your help. My friend Jimmy has absolutely zero sense of direction and may or may not have gotten himself lost. Like, super duper lost. All I know is his flight shouldâ€™ve taken off from somewhere in the US at 12:59 PM on March 17th, and this picture that he sent me. Can you tell me what flight he is on? (Flag format: wctf{XX####}, use IATA airline code)
